Goal for this project:
  My goal for following along with this tutorial by CodingNepal was to sharpen up my HTML, CSS, and JS 
  knowledge as I haven't used these languages in over a year. 

Challenges I overcame:
  1.) Using Visual Studio Code and importing images
  2.) Figuring out how to use a JS terminal
